It includes a large and coherent environmental and biological survey (consultable here http://www.obs-vlfr.fr/data/view/) and have previously be part of OSD between 2012 and 2015. The long term sampling have also been used for various genomic sampling in the past (discontinued depending on projects). It is sometimes prone to HAB (with high recurrence of ostreopsis on summer) and is part of PHYTOBS surveys. It is prone to phytoplankton blooms (usually in March/April). It is complemented with high frequency CTD sampling and weelkly plankton tows.
